## Quick overview

Note keeping React application served by a Express/Node backend and Mongo database, also known as the MERN stack. Basic CRUD operations on notes can be performed in a rich WYSIWYG text editor provided by TinyMCE. The application contains one of many possible solutions for creating a desktop/mobile responsive multi-row grid carousel using the SwiperJS library, which carousel libraries like Swiper typically do not natively support. Users have the option of logging into an account and initiating an express session, either locally with a registered email/password combination, or by using Google OAuth 2.0. 

I created this project to familiarize myself with Javascript and full-stack web development. Due to the purpose of the project being learning, AI and tutorials were not used to produce any code. An enormous amount was learned about JS, MERN, and full-stack web development through research, documentation and iteration!
